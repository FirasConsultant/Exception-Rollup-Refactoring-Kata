Exception Rollup Refactoring Kata
==================================

For practicing the refactoring "Roll up loop". This is the inverse of the better-known refactoring "Unroll loop".

Focus on improving the code in the MessageEnricher class. It's currently a series of if statements. See if you can turn it into a loop.

Note there is a branch 'with_tests' if you'd like to go straight to doing the refactoring and skip writing them yourself.
